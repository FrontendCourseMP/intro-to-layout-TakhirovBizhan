            <h2 class="About_us">About us:
                Our Story and Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We explored various aspects of cryptocurrencies,
                including using Bitcoin for payments, mining,
                and trading with different strategies. We also considered
                starting a company and extensively researched Ethereum
                and smart contracts. However, we struggled to find a
                viable business model. Concerns about government
                intervention and the potential ban of Bitcoin always
                lingered. As a result, we pursued other entrepreneurial
                ventures and found some validation when the ICO
                wave ended with a crash.
            </p>
            <p>
                The positive developments in 2020 took us by surprise.
                The influx of capital from established institutions,
                including the financial industry, made it increasingly
                challenging for the government to ban Bitcoin. However,
                we acknowledge that they may still attempt to do so.
                Recently, when we attempted to transfer our old, now more
                valuable Bitcoin and Ether to a new wallet, we discovered
                that we had lost access to them completely.
                We were unable to locate our wallets in the first place.

                    By a stupid mistake, I wrote down only 11 of 12 words of my seed phrase.
                    Desperately I tried it myself but gave up after a short time. By chance,
                    I came across ReWallet and asked if it would be possible to restore
                    access to my wallet. Shorthand later we arranged a meeting in
                    Berlin for the delivery of the seed phrase. About 4 weeks later
                    I got the email that they have restored
                    the access. Guys, you are great, we need people like you.
